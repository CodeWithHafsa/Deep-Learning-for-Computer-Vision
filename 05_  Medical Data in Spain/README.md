# Medical Data in Spain

In this project, you'll look at using neural networks to generate new images. You'll do this using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) system, both by building one and using a pre-trained GAN. The images you'll generate will be a variety of medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs. You'll also create a web app using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the GAN. Additionally, you'll use Git and GitHub to track the app's code.

Some of the things you'll learn are:

* How to create and train a GAN
* How to use a pre-trained GAN to generate images and data
* How to train a model using synthetic data from a GAN
* How to build a web app using Streamlit
