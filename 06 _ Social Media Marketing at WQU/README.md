# Social Media Marketing at WQU

### Project Overview
In this project, you'll use Stable Diffusion to create images from text descriptions. You'll assemble the Stable Diffusion pipeline using several pre-trained neural networks, and learn how to fine-tune the networks to include new image information. With the goal of generating meme-worthy images, you'll also create and deploy a Streamlit app to be a front-end to your fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model. This will allow a non-technical marketing team to generate such images easily.

Some of the things you'll learn are:
* How to work with the pieces that make up the Stable Diffusion process
* How to use the pipelines that Stable Diffusion provides
* How to use LoRA to fine-tune Stable Diffusion with your own images
* How to create a Streamlit app that lets users interact with Stable Diffusion
* How to make your app accessible to others by deploying it to Streamlit Community Cloud
